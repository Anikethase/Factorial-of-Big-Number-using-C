# Factorial-of-Big-Number-using-C
I think you not think yet or while think first time.
But it's great. Now you are coming towards actual C Programming.

Normal Factorial Techniques(Non-recursive or Recursive) does not give a Factorial of a very Big Number. 
Example:
Input : 10 then these normal technique gives you correct Output.
But Normal program fails for larger input such as 50, 100 etc.

Reason :
Integer variable take 4 byte(May differ according to your processer 32-bit or 64-bit).
The range of -32,768 to 32,767 or -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. So factorial of 20 and above contains more numbers which are not fitted on that range.

So above attachment gives you the perfect solution for finding Factorial of every number is in your mind.

Not using any Pointer and Structure. It's pretty easy to understand.

Thank You!!!!
